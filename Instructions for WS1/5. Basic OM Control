1. Open terminal in Ubuntu and run roscore

$ roscore

After which, prepare the setup for the OM: Connect the wires, switch on the power, and manually bring up the OM

***Note: If your port (e.g. ACM0) is denied permission, on new terminal type:
	$ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0

2. On another terminal, activate the controller

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_controller open_manipulator_controller.launch

***You have to do Steps 1 and 2 first before you can control the virtual robot via the following various methods

############### ROS BASICS (For OM) ###############
Open new terminal and try the following (one by one):

$ rostopic list

$ rosservice list

$ rostopic echo /joint_states -n1

############ Method 1 - Manual Control ############

Type (in New Terminal):

$ roslaunch open_manipulator_teleop open_manipulator_teleop_keyboard.launch

If the node is successfully launched, the instructions will appear in the terminal window. Use your keyboard keys to control the arm; response will reflect in the Gazebo. Close terminal when done

############ Method 2 - Control via Python ############

For actual OM/Virtual OM, you have to service topics to move the arm (covered previously)

Open terminal and type:

$ rosrun robotics control_om.py

*ensure that your codes are in the src folder of your robotics package
*ensure you have given permissions to your python files (1. cd to directory; 2. chmod +x your_codes.py)

The OM will move to a point determined by the joint angles. To alter these joint angles, open the python file, find the following line and change the angles in it; these angles are in radians:

joint_position.position = [-0.5, 0, 0.5, -0.5]

To alter the gripper angles, alter the following line (-0.01 for fully close and 0.01 for fully open):

gripper_position.position = [0.01]
